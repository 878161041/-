# Procedural Patterns to use with Tilemaps

## Description

This project shows a number of different patterns to use with Tilemaps to create custom maps. 
All the main functions are within the script [MapFunctions.cs](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/ProceduralPatterns2D/blob/master/Assets/Global/MapFunctions.cs).

Within the project are individual scenes which show off the different functions.

Also included in this project is an implementation of the MapFunctions.cs script that allows for a scriptable object called MapLayer to exist, which can be seen in [MapLayer.cs](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/ProceduralPatterns2D/blob/master/Assets/Global/MapLayer.cs).
This scriptable object can be used to determine which algorithm each layer of your level uses.

To see an implementation that uses the MapLayer scriptable object, see the script [LevelGenerator.cs](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/ProceduralPatterns2D/blob/master/Assets/Global/LevelGenerator.cs).
