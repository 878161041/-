# Procedural Patterns to use with Tilemaps

## Description

This project shows a number of different patterns to use with Tilemaps to create custom maps. 
All the main functions are within the script MapFunctions.cs

Within the project are individual scenes which show off the different functions.

Also included in this project is an implementation of the MapFunctions.cs script that allows for a scriptable object called MapLayer to exist, which can be seen in MapLayer.cs.
This scriptable object can be used to determine which algorithm each layer of your level uses.

To see an implementation that uses the MapLayer scriptable object, see the script LevelGenerator.cs
